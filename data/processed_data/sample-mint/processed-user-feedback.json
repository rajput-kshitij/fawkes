Maybe change that to total debt instead of making a negative number portray your self worth. Also a quick debt to income ratio bar may be a nice feature, over time as you budget you can visually see the bar change. \n\nLastly, I understand this is connected with turbo tax intuit and I did use turbo tax for a few years but I no longer do, please create an external way to link tax history for records keeping. \nI know updates will continue to happen but I hop this review helps as feedback.",

Dropped Quicken and am back to Mint. Wish Mint had more features, but given that its free, and better than the paid option, I have to give it 5 stars.

Does it make it complicated as hell to do this accurately? Also yes. \nIve been using this app for years, and it was great at first, but it has truly gone downhill over the years. \nIf you truly want a customized experience, you HAVE to do it on the website instead of the app, due to a solid third of the budget categories not being available in the app to assign transactions. Not to mention, when transactions come through, they almost never get assigned to any kind of relevant category, so you have to go through and re-assign nearly every fracking transaction on all accounts in order to ensure your budgets are actually tracked accurately... \nAdditionally, theres always at least two accounts that Mint just cant seem to keep up with, if not more, so youre going in daily to refresh accounts. Not to mention the fact that it doesnt even recognize all accounts, so until it catches up with the times, you cant track your investments/etc. unless theyre with old school companies. \nI finally got fed up enough to just cancel the account, as its more work than its worth (and my online bank has a better budgeting/financial tracking system than this app). However, in true Mint fashion, it took THREE rounds of manually deleting accounts, per the websites instructions, for the site to finally remove them. Ironically enough, however, deleting my account as a whole was super easy!\nOverall, if you have simple/old school budgetary needs and accounts, then youre solid with this tool. Additionally, if you care more about your credit score and refinancing all the things, then this new version of the app is for you! Otherwise, do some research and find something else that works, because Mint is now much too convoluted and exhaustive to be worth it for anything else.",

Now that Im trying to get a wrap on my financial health, Ive decided to give Mint a shot at claiming the role as my number one financial app (budgeting, expense tracking, investments, etc). \n\nIts not perfect; Id love to be able to easily enter my gross paycheck and track my deductions like health insurance, social security and 401k, which I cannot seem to find a way to do this. Nor can I easily add offline accounts or make adjustments to the built-in categories; I can only do that from the website interface, which lessens the need for having the app on my device. Regarding said offline accounts, even once added via the site, I cant easily adjust the balance of that account in the app, I have to do that via the website as well.\n\nThese limitations of the app that are rectified via the site wouldnt be so bad if I werent bombarded by pop-up advertisements the moment I log in, but its a free service and I realize they need to have some sort of funding to remain afloat.\n\nWhen its all said and done, its not a bad solution and the fact that it syncs with the majority of my accounts is a bonus. That said, if I could find something akin to a mobile device version of Microsoft Money Sunset, Id prefer that, even if I had to manually enter all my transactions. I find that keeps me more aware of my spending than anything else.",

        "message": "I like how its linked to your bank account and how you can assign a category to each expense. It makes things pretty simple. I create my budget on an excel spreadsheet and then put all my categories in Mint and make it to a zero-balance. What I dont like is that you cant go back and edit past budgets( lets say I fell off on updating my transactions or things changed and so I need to edit). Also, you have to wait til the first of the month to actually create your new budget. I really highly dont like this. You guys should make a feature to where we can create our budgets out in the future. Another reason for the 2 stars is that Mint rounds and its not exact to the dollar and cent which means sometimes its hard to categorize things like extra money. Id say its a pretty great BASIC app, but I think I may start looking elsewhere like EveryDollar or somewhere where the features are a bit more practical. Its not practical or Proactive to create a budget the first day you need the budget. Also, do you guys take into account that some people may not work monthly? But no-weekly this should be an option as well! A very basic app that needs updated and practical features.",

I was working on my credit and it was steadily rising. I reached a number I was confident in and started the process to buy a house. Much to my surprise, my credit score (the highest of the 3) came in 150 POINTS LOWER than what Mint said. Upon research, the number Mint shows is not your FICO score, which is what lenders use. I would never have applied had I known where I really stood. Now Im embarrassed and unbelievably disappointed. Skip this app. There are much better ones out there, Im sure.",

It thinks HEB Groceries payments are Utilities. It thinks Spectrum Internet is Alcohol and Bars. It thinks my electricity bill is Fees. It thinks my monthly Patreon payment is Gym. And on and on. Every month. These arent uncommon merchants. Youd think it could learn from the input I provide every month; but no, the 50th correction might as well be the first. (Having to use the website to fix this defeats the purpose of categorizing transactions in the app.)\n\nMint also helpfully notifies me every time I get a paycheck.

First the UX is way off for the tabs, the common actions from the overview tab should be spread out into the other tabs because I see myself only using this one tab 95% of the time and scrolling up and down for the common actions is a pain. Maybe add a side menu to make it much easier to select these. Second, it feels like its lacking the historical overview and analysis that I want with an app like this. I can add a budget for the current month for something new like bills but this new budget does not get applied to the previous month so Im unable to see it. This budget should also allow a view to see your trends on it. Another pain is the [Month] Spending section. I cant view previous months only the current one and when a new month comes You are stuck to only seeing those couple days of transactions. This is very troubling given that the graphs and info provided in this section are very well made yet under utilized. Please update these things and I will consider increasing my rating\n\nTL:DR This app is great for looking at your spending habits yet lacks several features to look into trends and historical data, this restricts it to really only working as a budget tool and makes it nearly impossible to make new analysis on spending habits that havent been  predefined",

If I went over $100 over my home improvement budget (since I only have one monthly payment for my roof expense), it used to notify me that I went to Lowes the other day! Please help me.

But since COVID happened and I have been making much less than my usual paychecks, I have struggled to keep a more strict budget. I downloaded this app to help me stay on top of things, and it has really helped me. Ive been able to see not only just what I have left to spend in each of the categories, but other acts as well from my life insurance acct, my student loans, credit card debts, etc. Its been great being able to see it all in one place instead of looking it up on several individual websites. The only issue Ive been having is that when I put in the info to get my credit score, it says to protect my privacy my account has been locked and to try again another time. It doesnt ever show me what the credit score is. Other than that I have been absolutely loving this app!",

I want to be able to see my spending trends from month to month to see how my spending is changing, but I can only look at previous month information in the transaction section. I cant see the graphs and charts and category breakdowns once the month is over. Without being able to see the trends and spending habits, I dont really need the app. Creating a budget on the app is nice but takes a lot of work to maintain. And once the month is over I cant see how often I went over or under budget. This app helped me a lot for a couple months while I closely monitored my spending to determine what my budget should look like. Once that was done I stopped using the app because now I need to see if Im staying on track and how my budget needs to change. Without trend data and past month spending reports, I cant do that.",
